   <h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<p>My site will be a professional portfolio that is one page and includes the following sections. </p>

<p><b>Welcome:</b> I would like movement on my profile to catch the users eye, so I will have a moving photo/background. My name will be overlaid the photo in big font.Right underneath my name will be icons that connect to my Linkedin, github, and email address so people can contact me. Below the photo there will be open space that states, "I am a web developer".</p>
<p><b>About Me:</b> This section will have a photo of myself on the left. To the right there is text that explains my career background and what skills I can offer as a Web Developer. It will include programming language as well as soft skills. I will add in some hobbies so the website comes off as personal and the user can get to know me more.</p>
<p><b>Portfolio:</b>I only have three images at this point. I will include my capstone project and hopefully two other projects that will be volunteer websites. These images will be responsive so that they stack on top of each other in mobile view.</p>

<h1>Wireframes</h1>

This website will be responsive on large and small screens. I created the wireframes on MockFlow.
